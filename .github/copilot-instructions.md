- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.

Cloudflare Project Instructions for GitHub Copilot
1. Project Context & Goal
- User: Stephen (Oceanside, CA).
- Hardware: ChargePoint Home Flex (CPH50).
- Goal: Robustly automate charging to start at 6:00 AM local time daily.
- Criticality: High; failures must alert.

2. Technical Architecture
- Platform: Cloudflare Workers (V8 Isolate), language: TypeScript.
- Trigger: Cron Triggers.
- Schedule: 0 13,14 * * * (runs 13:00 and 14:00 UTC); worker must check America/Los_Angeles time and exit unless hour === 6 to handle DST automatically.

3. Unofficial ChargePoint Mobile API
- Authentication: POST https://account.chargepoint.com/account/v1/driver/auth/login with JSON body {"username","password"}; capture set-cookie and access_token from JSON.
- Start Charging: POST https://mc.chargepoint.com/map-prod/v2 with Cookie (from login) and Authorization: Bearer <token>. Body:
	{
		"station_id": "<STATION_ID>",
		"action": "start_session",
		"product": "driver",
		"device_id": "cloudflare-worker"
	}

4. Failure & Retry Policy
- Wrap fetches in retry: 3 attempts, exponential backoff (e.g., 2s, 4s, 8s).
- On start-session failure after retries: log console error with full response body; send MailChannels email to env.ALERT_EMAIL with subject "⚠️ URGENT: EV Charging Failed" (standard Cloudflare pattern).

5. Configuration & Secrets (Wrangler)
- Env interface:
	export interface Env {
		CP_USERNAME: string;
		CP_PASSWORD: string;
		CP_STATION_ID: string;
		ALERT_EMAIL: string;
		TZ_REGION: "America/Los_Angeles";
	}

6. Migration Guidelines (Python -> TypeScript)
- No Node.js APIs (no os, fs, requests, etc.).
- requests.post -> fetch; requests.Session -> custom cookie/token management.
- Auth flow: login -> capture token/cookies -> start session -> get station_id (or use provided) -> send start charge.

7. Code Structure & Style
- Use scheduled handler: export default { async scheduled(event: ScheduledEvent, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) { /* logic */ } }.
- On non-200 responses, log specific error codes and exit gracefully.
- Tone: concise, technical, functional; avoid fluff.

<!--
## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
